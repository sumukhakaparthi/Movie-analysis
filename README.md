# TMDb Movie analysis
This project is about investigating a dataset that contains information of 10000 + movies collected from The Movie Database(TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. This dataset is extracted from kaggle : [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). In this project I have analyzed the dataset to answer some questions that include:
1. Which genres is most popular in movie making ?
2. Which Genre has more popularity within audience ?
3. Are movie releses incresing with time?
4. Visualisation of yearly revenue with time.
